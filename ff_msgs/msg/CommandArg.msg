# An argument to a command sent through RAPID

# Note that this is approximating a union in DDS. However, this is an
# inefficient union, and thus each instance will take up at least 89 bytes.
# However, even with the maximum of 16 arguments to a command, we only have
# about 1k extra data. I, tfmorse, am ok with that. Commands are rarely sent.
